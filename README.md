## Background/About
This application is a recreation of the popular Coolors website in which we implemented our own server for data handling and a twist on the design on the frontend. Users can randomly generate color palettes that they can then save to projects in order to keep track of them. Changes made by the user are then persisted in the backend server.

## Next Steps
#### Future iterations of the project could include:
- Drag and Drop functionality for the different palettes and projects
- Allow users to adjust color of each palette color via a slider or hexcode
- Have a login system so that there can be more than one user
